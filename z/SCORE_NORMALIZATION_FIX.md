# Score Normalization Fix Summary

## Issue Description
Search APIs were using inconsistent relevance score ranges (0-1 vs 0-100), causing filtering to fail when applying 0-100 thresholds to 0-1 scores. This resulted in no search results being returned even when relevant matches existed.

## Root Cause
Different search engines and embedding models return similarity/relevance scores in different ranges:
- Some return scores in 0-1 range (cosine similarity, etc.)
- Some return scores in 0-100 range (custom scoring algorithms)
- All API endpoints expected 0-100 range for filtering

## Files Fixed

### 1. `apis/retriever_api.py` ✅ FIXED
**Functions updated:**
- `mango_retriever_search()`
- `langchain_retriever_search()`
- `mango_retriever_search_with_jd()`
- `langchain_retriever_search_with_jd()`

**Changes:**
- Added score normalization logic: `if score <= 1.0: normalized_score = score * 100`
- Updated result objects to use normalized scores for consistent filtering

### 2. `apis/enhanced_search.py` ✅ FIXED
**Functions updated:**
- `smart_search()`
- `context_search()`

**Changes:**
- Added score normalization for similarity_score and relevance_score
- Ensured all scores are in 0-100 range before filtering

### 3. `apis/vector_search.py` ✅ ALREADY CORRECT
**Status:** Already had proper normalization on line 432
```python
result["relevance_score"] = round(result.get("score", 0) * 100, 2)
```

### 4. `apis/vectore_search_v2.py` ✅ ALREADY CORRECT
**Status:** Already had proper normalization on line 293
```python
result["relevance_score"] = round(result.get("score", 0) * 100, 2)
```

### 5. `apis/manual_search.py` ✅ ALREADY CORRECT
**Status:** Already calculates scores in 0-100 range
- Uses normalized scoring algorithm with diversity bonus
- Final score capped at 100

### 6. `apis/rag_search.py` ✅ FIXED
**Functions updated:**
- `vector_similarity_search()`
- `llm_context_search()`
- `llm_search_by_jd()`
- `vector_search_by_jd()`

**Changes:**
- Added score normalization for similarity_score, relevance_score, and match_score
- Fixed filtering logic to use normalized scores directly instead of multiplying by 100

## Normalization Logic Applied

```python
# For similarity_score, relevance_score, and match_score
if score <= 1.0:
    normalized_score = round(score * 100, 2)
else:
    normalized_score = score  # Already in 0-100 range
```

## Testing Verification
All search APIs now:
1. ✅ Normalize scores to 0-100 range consistently
2. ✅ Apply relevant_score thresholds correctly
3. ✅ Return results when matches exist above threshold
4. ✅ Maintain backward compatibility with existing clients

## Impact
- **Before:** Search filtering failed due to score range mismatch (0-1 vs 0-100)
- **After:** All search APIs consistently use 0-100 score range for filtering
- **Result:** Search functionality now works correctly across all endpoints

## Files Not Changed
- All other search-related files were verified and found to be using correct scoring already
- No changes needed to database schemas or client interfaces
- Existing API contracts maintained

## Status: COMPLETE ✅
