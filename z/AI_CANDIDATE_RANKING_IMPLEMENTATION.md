# AI Candidate Ranking Feature Implementation

## 🎯 Overview

The AI Candidate Ranking feature provides intelligent, automated candidate evaluation against job descriptions. It includes comprehensive skills matching, experience relevance scoring, and automatic rejection of candidates below a 40% match threshold.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. **Skills Match Analysis** 🔍
- **Skills Match Percentage**: Calculates exact percentage of required skills matched
- **Missing Skills Identification**: Lists specific skills required but missing from candidate
- **Additional Skills Discovery**: Shows extra skills candidate possesses beyond requirements
- **Semantic Matching**: Uses AI to match similar skills (e.g., "React.js" matches "React")

### 2. **Experience Relevance Scoring** 📊
- **Relevant Experience Calculation**: Estimates years of relevant experience based on job titles
- **Experience Match Percentage**: Compares candidate experience to job requirements
- **Role Matching**: Identifies which job titles align with requirements
- **Experience Level Assessment**: Evaluates if candidate meets minimum experience criteria

### 3. **Automatic Rejection System** ❌
- **40% Threshold**: Automatically rejects candidates with overall match score below 40%
- **Status Tagging**: Tags rejected candidates with "CV Rejected - In Process"
- **Accepted Status**: Tags qualifying candidates with "CV Accepted - Under Review"
- **Configurable Threshold**: Easy to adjust rejection percentage based on requirements

### 4. **Comprehensive Scoring Algorithm** 🧮
- **Weighted Scoring**: Uses sophisticated algorithm with configurable weights
  - Skills: 40% weight
  - Experience: 30% weight  
  - Education: 15% weight
  - Location: 10% weight
  - Salary: 5% weight
- **Overall Match Score**: Provides 0-100 score for each candidate

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Skills Matching Algorithm
```python
def calculate_skills_match(candidate_skills, job_requirements):
    """
    Advanced skills matching with semantic understanding
    - Exact matches: Direct skill name matching
    - Partial matches: Substring matching for related skills
    - Semantic matching: AI-powered skill relationship detection
    """
```

### Experience Relevance Calculation
```python
def calculate_experience_relevance(candidate, job_requirements):
    """
    Intelligent experience assessment
    - Job title matching against requirements
    - Years calculation with relevant experience estimation
    - Role similarity scoring
    """
```

### Overall Score Algorithm
```python
def calculate_overall_match_score(skills, experience, education, location, salary):

## 🎯 Use Cases

### 1. **Recruitment Automation**
```python
# Auto-rank candidates for a Python developer position
response = await rank_candidates_by_job_text({
    "job_description": "Senior Python Developer with Django experience...",
    "user_id": "recruiter123",
    "max_candidates": 100,
    "include_rejected": False  # Only get qualified candidates
})

# Result: Top candidates with detailed match analysis
qualified_candidates = [c for c in response.candidates if not c.is_auto_rejected]
```

### 2. **Skills Gap Analysis**
```python
# Identify what skills candidates are missing
for candidate in response.candidates:
    missing_skills = candidate.skills_match.missing_skills
    if missing_skills:
        print(f"{candidate.name} needs: {', '.join(missing_skills)}")
```

### 3. **Bulk Candidate Processing**
```python
# Process candidates from job description file
with open("job_description.pdf", "rb") as f:
    response = await rank_candidates_by_job_file(
        file=f,
        user_id="hr_team",
        max_candidates=200,
        include_rejected=True  # See all candidates for analysis
