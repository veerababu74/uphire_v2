# MongoDB Connection Timeout Fix - Summary

## Problem
The application was failing to start with a MongoDB connection timeout error:
```
pymongo.errors.NetworkTimeout: ac-mvw4vxc-shard-00-01.aw2gzuy.mongodb.net:27017: timed out
```

This happened because the `LangChainRetriever` and `MangoRetriever` classes were trying to connect to MongoDB during module import at application startup, blocking the entire application if the database was unavailable.

## Solution
Implemented **lazy initialization** pattern to defer MongoDB connection until the retrievers are actually used.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Retriever Classes (`Retrivers/retriver.py`)

#### MangoRetriever Class:
- ✅ Added `lazy_init` parameter to constructor (defaults to `True`)
- ✅ Added `_initialized` flag to track initialization state
- ✅ Added `_ensure_initialized()` method to initialize on first use
- ✅ Added MongoDB connection timeout settings (5 seconds)
- ✅ Enhanced error handling for connection errors
- ✅ Added retry mechanism decorator for connection reliability

#### LangChainRetriever Class:
- ✅ Same lazy initialization pattern as MangoRetriever
- ✅ Proper handling of LangChain vector store initialization
- ✅ Connection timeout and retry mechanisms

#### RAGRetriever Class:
- ✅ Updated with lazy initialization pattern
- ✅ Connection timeout settings

### 2. Updated API Layer (`apis/retriever_api.py`)
- ✅ Modified retriever instantiation to use lazy initialization:
  ```python
  mango_retriever = MangoRetriever(lazy_init=True)
  langchain_retriever = LangChainRetriever(lazy_init=True)
  ```
- ✅ Added logger initialization

### 3. Added Health Check API (`apis/retriever_health.py`)
- ✅ Created new health check endpoint `/retriever/health`
- ✅ Provides status of both retriever services
- ✅ Can be used to monitor database connectivity

### 4. Updated Main Application (`main.py`)
- ✅ Added health check router import and registration
- ✅ Application now starts successfully even if MongoDB is unavailable

### 5. Enhanced Error Handling
- ✅ Added specific handling for MongoDB connection errors:
  - `NetworkTimeout`
  - `ServerSelectionTimeoutError` 
  - `ConnectionFailure`
- ✅ User-friendly error messages
- ✅ Graceful degradation when database is unavailable

## Benefits

1. **Fast Startup**: Application starts immediately without waiting for database connection
2. **Resilient**: Application runs even when MongoDB is temporarily unavailable
3. **Better UX**: Users get meaningful error messages instead of application crashes
4. **Monitoring**: Health check endpoint allows monitoring of service status
5. **Production Ready**: Proper timeout and retry mechanisms for production environments

## Testing

Created test scripts to verify the fix:
- ✅ `test_lazy_init.py` - Confirms lazy initialization works
- ✅ `test_main_import.py` - Confirms main application imports successfully
- ✅ Both tests pass successfully

## Usage

### Health Check
```bash
GET /retriever/health
```

Returns:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "services": {
    "mango_retriever": "healthy",
    "langchain_retriever": "healthy"
  }
}
```

### API Endpoints
All existing retriever endpoints continue to work as before, but now:
- Initialize connection only when first called
- Handle connection errors gracefully
- Provide meaningful error responses

## Next Steps
1. Monitor the health check endpoint in production
2. Consider adding more detailed health metrics
3. Implement connection pooling if needed for high load scenarios

The application should now start successfully even with MongoDB connection issues and provide a better user experience.
