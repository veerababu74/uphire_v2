# Priority-Based Search Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented priority-based search functionality across all search APIs in the UPHire system. The new search prioritization follows the requested hierarchy:

1. **1st Priority: Designation/Role (40% weight)**
2. **2nd Priority: Location (30% weight)**  
3. **3rd Priority: Skills, Experience, and Salary (30% combined weight)**
   - Skills: 15%
   - Experience: 10%
   - Salary: 5%

## Files Modified

### 1. RAG Search Engine Core (`Rag/enhanced_search_processor.py`)
- **Updated `calculate_relevance_score()` method** to implement priority-based scoring
- **Added new `_score_designation()` method** that combines role and domain matching
- **Added new `_score_role_match()` method** for detailed role/designation matching
- **Reorganized scoring weights** to match the priority hierarchy

### 2. Vector Search API (`apis/vector_search.py`)
- **Added comprehensive priority scoring functions**:
  - `calculate_priority_score()` - Main scoring function
  - `calculate_designation_score()` - Role/designation matching
  - `calculate_location_score()` - Location matching
  - `calculate_skills_score()` - Skills matching
  - `calculate_experience_score()` - Experience matching
  - `calculate_salary_score()` - Salary matching
- **Updated result processing** to apply priority scoring and re-sort results
- **Enhanced both `vector_search()` and `search_by_jd()` functions**

### 3. Vector Search V2 API (`apis/vectore_search_v2.py`)
- **Added identical priority scoring functions** as vector_search.py
- **Updated both search functions** to apply priority-based scoring
- **Implemented proper sorting** by priority-based relevance scores

### 4. Retriever API (`apis/retriever_api.py`)
- **Added priority scoring functions** matching other APIs
- **Created `apply_priority_scoring_to_results()` helper function** to avoid code duplication
- **Updated both Mango and LangChain search functions** to use priority scoring
- **Enhanced JD-based search functions** with priority logic

### 5. Enhanced Search API (`apis/enhanced_search.py`)
- **No direct changes needed** - automatically benefits from RAG engine updates
- The enhanced search API uses the RAG application which now has priority-based scoring

## Key Features Implemented

### Priority Scoring Algorithm
```python
# Priority weights:
designation_score * 0.4 +    # 1st Priority: Role/Designation
location_score * 0.3 +       # 2nd Priority: Location  
skills_score * 0.15 +        # 3rd Priority: Skills
experience_score * 0.1 +     # 3rd Priority: Experience
salary_score * 0.05          # 3rd Priority: Salary
```

### Intelligent Matching Logic
- **Designation Matching**: Searches through experience roles, labels, and related skills
- **Location Matching**: Matches current city and preferred locations
- **Skills Matching**: Fuzzy matching of technical and soft skills
- **Experience Matching**: Range-based matching with tolerance
- **Salary Matching**: Budget-based matching with flexibility

### Enhanced Result Processing
- **Combined Scoring**: Priority score (70%) + Vector similarity (30%)
- **Automatic Sorting**: Results sorted by final relevance score
- **Detailed Match Reasons**: Explanations for why candidates matched
- **Multiple Score Metrics**: Priority score, vector score, and combined relevance score

## Backward Compatibility
- All existing API endpoints remain unchanged
- Response formats enhanced with additional scoring fields:
  - `relevance_score`: Final combined score (0-100)
  - `priority_score`: Priority-based score (0-100) 
  - `vector_score`: Original vector similarity score (0-100)
  - `match_reason`: Explanation of match criteria

## Testing Results
- ✅ All syntax checks passed
- ✅ Priority scoring algorithm validated
- ✅ Different search scenarios tested successfully
- ✅ Perfect score (100%) for exact matches
- ✅ Appropriate partial scoring for incomplete matches

## Usage Examples

### High Priority Match (100% score):
- Query: "Senior Software Engineer in Bangalore with Python skills 5 years experience"
- Matches: Role ✓, Location ✓, Skills ✓, Experience ✓

### Medium Priority Match (64% score):  
- Query: "Software engineer in Mumbai"
- Matches: Role ✓, Location ✓ (preferred city)

### Lower Priority Match (32% score):
- Query: "Developer in Chennai 8 lakh salary" 
- Matches: Role ✓ (partial)

## Benefits
1. **More Relevant Results**: Candidates with matching designations and locations appear first
2. **Better User Experience**: Results are prioritized based on most important criteria
3. **Flexible Matching**: Supports partial matches with appropriate scoring
4. **Transparency**: Clear explanations of why candidates matched
5. **Consistent Implementation**: Same logic applied across all search APIs

## API Endpoints Updated
- `/rag/vector-similarity-search` - RAG vector search
- `/rag/llm-context-search` - RAG LLM search  
- `/rag/llm-search-by-jd` - RAG JD-based search
- `/rag/vector-search-by-jd` - RAG vector JD search
- `/ai/search` - Standard vector search
- `/ai/search-by-jd` - Vector JD search
- `/aiv1/search` - Vector search v2
- `/aiv1/search-by-jd` - Vector JD search v2
- `/search/mango` - Mango retriever search
- `/search/langchain` - LangChain retriever search
- `/enhanced-search/smart-search` - Enhanced smart search
- `/enhanced-search/context-search` - Enhanced context search

The implementation ensures that all semantic searches across the UPHire platform now prioritize results based on Designation (1st), Location (2nd), and Skills/Experience/Salary (3rd) as requested.
